# Women in Magazine Features

Data analysis inspired by a recent controversy over the Jeffrey Goldberg's [comments](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/06/promoting-based-on-potential-how-the-atlantic-is-putting-a-lot-more-women-in-charge/) on women in the media.

```
Itâ€™s really, really hard to write a 10,000-word cover story. There are not a lot of journalists in America who can do it. The journalists in America who do it are almost exclusively white males.
```

There's a popular interpretation that says Goldberg thinks women can't write features or cover stories. It's neither correct nor generous. He's really saying women haven't gotten the chance to write those features. That interpretation was also controversial. A lot of journalists chimed in to argue there are many female journalists who're writing these long features. They're just ignored by Goldbrg.

Is Goldberg right? Let's scrape a few popular legacy magazines for their features, and see how many men and women wrote them.

Magazines of interest:

- The Atlantic
- New York Magazine
- The New Yorker
- The New York Times Magazine
- Harper's
- Vanity Fair
